# MWC Wallet

This is the reference implementation of MWC's wallet. It consists of 2 major pieces:

* The MWC Wallet APIs, which are intended for use by MWC community wallet developers. The wallet APIs can be directly linked into other projects or invoked via a JSON-RPC interface.

* A reference command-line wallet, which provides a baseline wallet for MWC and demonstrates how the wallet APIs should be called.

# Usage

To use the command-line wallet, we recommend using the latest release from the Releases page. There are distributions for Linux, MacOS and Windows.

Full documentation outlining how to use the command line wallet can be found on [MWC's Wiki](https://github.com/whyproject/docs/wiki/Wallet-User-Guide)
